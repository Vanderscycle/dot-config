## Markdown

### Background

* Markdown is extremely powerful and expandable document writing file system that resembles wiki. A quick basic syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and the website contains more advanced usages of markdown. Since the implementation of markdown varies wildly from superset (e.g. GitHub Flavoured Markdown) and can be expanded through [GitHub](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)

### Required things to do
* Using a spell [checker](https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck) and configuring it proprely.
* Faster and seemless method to insert template on new notes.
* Vimwiki integration between Notion and obsidian.
