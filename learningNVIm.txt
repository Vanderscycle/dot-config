How to exist VIM
Esc (brings you to normal mode)
:wq (saves and quit)
:q! (quits without saving)

This is a small test

Movement (Normal mode) 

HJKL (left down up right) look at your keyboard
To move between paragraphs use {} Paragraghs need a space for Vim to recoginze them
gg (move top of the page)
G (move to the bottom of the page)

0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
$ moves the cursor to the end of the line
^ moves the cursor to the beginning (non space/tab section of the line)
		0w (makes the same)

w (word) moves the cursor to the right one word at a time (beginning of the word)
e (end word) moves the cursor to the right to the end of the next word to the right
b (back) moves the cursor to the left one word at a time 
W (capital) same as w expect you break at spaces
B same as b except you break at spaces

Misc:
~ capitalize or lower a character
The (.) allows you to repeat the last executed command
	e.g. dd followed by ...... (I still prefer shift+v)
	Really powerful to replace item between () just be careful with location e.g c+t+ delimiting char
	or replace an entire line by something else C + (replacement) and navigate around to the next sentence and ....

# number jk (moves # lines up or down)
# number hl (moves # characters left or right)
# number hl (moves # between paragraphs)
# number w/b/e (moves # between words)
:# (line number brings you to the actual line)
* bring you to all instances of the word also highlights it(plugin) 
# + ~ change capitalize or lower the next # of chars
# + r replace the next # letters with the one you are about to enter
camera:
z center the page around your cursor

Editing 
t+(letter or punctuation) moves you before the first instance of the letter
f+(letter or punctuation) moves you on the first instance of the letter
% takes you to specific block parenthesis alternates 
		d% deletes the content between the block (including the block)
r replace a letter
R replace all the letters 
o enter edit mode (adds a newline after the current line you are one)
O enters insert mode (adds a newline before the current line you are one)
i enter edit mode (before the cursor)
a enter edit mode (after the cursor)
A enter insert mode and place the cursor at the end of the line
I enters inser mode and place the currsor at the beginning of the line (ignores the spaces)

Indenting:
Select the range of code
>>
<< (with selection)
u Undo
ctr-r redo 

Copy paste cut
yy to copy an entire line (will add a newline)
y$ to copy an entire line (will not add a newline)
p to paste bellow the line
P to paste above the line

x deletes the charater the cursor is on without entering insert mode
		# + x number of characters to delete
dd deletes a line (also cuts it don't forget to use paste)
D deletes all content to the end of the line (on your cursor)
C deletes everything and brings you into inser mode (on your cursor)
c+w (change word) gets rid of the word and allows you to change that one instance
c + t + (letter/punctuation to) removes all content until the specified marker bring you to insert mode
d + t + (letter/punctuation to) same but deletes everything 

v + t + (letter/punctuation to) works for copy paste
		Of note it doesn't work with f

You can also use numbers 
# number d to delete # of lines
# number y to copy # of lines 

Marcros!!!
unlike . which do the last macro it allows you to record a set

q + letter to bind macro (starts the recording)
to exectute the recorded macro @ + letter it was binded to
# + @ + letter it was binded to do the macro for # of lines
Visual

navigate to the selection using the movement keys
	d to delete
	y to (yank)/copy
